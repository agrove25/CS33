gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2
   loaded the program into the gdb debugger

break Ftimes
   set a breakpoint at the specified function

set disassemble-next-line on
   allows us to examine the machine language code (rather than C)

set logging on
   allows us to automatically record output into gdb.txt (rather than copying
   and pasting repeatedly)

r -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'
   runs the tested command (which will call Ftimes and pause the debugger)

Used commands to examine the program:
   si: 	      	 	 step into, or move the program by one ML line
   info registers:	 get values for all the registers
   info $rax		 get values for rax (or any other register)

repeat commands till Ftimes returns.

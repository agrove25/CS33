O2 case:

testovf:
   xorl    %eax, %eax
   ret
   
this occurs due to the O2 flag, which optimizes it heavily. Due to the right
shift component, n has to be positive. Due to the 922..., which is the max
long limit, any given positive number will cause overflow. These two
cases are undefined behavior, and the compiler can return whatever
it wants, in this case, zero.

a.

because the sizeof operator returns an unsigned variable, the operation
is done with unsigned operations.

the condition has two possibilites:
   1. if maxbytes >= size_t: operation is meant to happen (the value is
      meant to be, and is greater than 0)

   2. if maxbytes < size_t: operation is not meant to happen, but due
      to the properties of unsigned variables, it will wrap around and
      become positive again.

b.

Change line 3 to:

if (maxbytes > 0 && maxbytes > sizeof(val))
